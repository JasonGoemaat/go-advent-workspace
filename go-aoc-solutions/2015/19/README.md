Another count the permutations of strings with replacements.   I really need
to remember the algorithm for this.

Oh, part 1 seems easy - all the distinct ways after doing ONE replacement.  I'm guessing
part 2 will either be combinations of replacements of the initial string or taking
the replaced string and counting a certain number of recursive replacements.
